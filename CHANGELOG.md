# Changelog

The releases of `schemas`.

Every repository of the project carries the same version and is tagged at the same moment, even where nothing changed, so an entry here may say that nothing was built. [Versioning](https://agentiik.github.io/docs#versioning) sets out why, and what a version promises before and after `1.0.0`.

`0.y.z` promises nothing beyond itself: what a release here describes may be gone in the next one.

## Unreleased

**The wire, written down first.** `wire.schema.json` describes every message that travels between the controller, the bus, the runner and the API: the task message and the task result, a runner's registration, its ten second heartbeat, the redemption of a task's grant, a log shipment, and a runner pool with the token issued from it. One document rather than one per message, because they share a vocabulary and a `$ref` may not leave a document here, so the run and task states, the identifiers, the digests and the idempotency key are written once and referenced.

What the shapes refuse is the point. A task message carries no secret value, no input URL and no image tag, and the objects are closed so that none of the three can be written at all rather than merely being undocumented. A task result ends in a task state and never a run state. A registration carries the public key and has no room for the private one. Twelve invalid fixtures pin those refusals, one rule each.

`tools/check.py` grew two things to hold it: a fixture group may name a member of a document rather than a whole document, so a fixture still pins one message, and a document that is a family has no instance at its root to illustrate.

## v0.1.2, 2026-09-13

Nothing changed here. The version moves because every repository carries the same one, which [Versioning](https://agentiik.github.io/docs#versioning) sets out.

The release is documentation: a [Get started](https://agentiik.github.io/docs#get-started) chapter at the top of the site, written from a run against `v0.1.1` rather than from what the rest of the page promises, and a recorded session of the command line on the home page.

## v0.1.1, 2026-09-13

This file, and nothing else.

`v0.1.0` was tagged before its changelog was written, and the fix for that is not to move the tag. Within minutes of the push, `sum.golang.org` had recorded the tagged commit of `agentiik` and `bricks` in a public append-only log and `proxy.golang.org` had cached it, so moving `v0.1.0` would have left `go get` serving the old code for ever and made a direct fetch fail with a checksum mismatch that reads as a supply-chain attack. A tag is a name somebody else pins, and a name that quietly comes to mean something else is worse than a second name.

So `v0.1.0` stays exactly where it is, describing exactly what it shipped, and this release adds the description. Every repository gets it at the same version on the same day, as every release here does. From now on a version's entry is merged before its tag is placed, which is written down in the conventions the documentation fixes.

## v0.1.0, 2026-09-12

The contract, released before anything reads it.

- `workflow.schema.json` describes `agentiik.yaml`: `apiVersion`, `kind`, `metadata`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `on`, `mcp`, `include`, `vars`, `secrets`, `defaults`, `concurrency`, `timeout` and `steps`, with every step keyword the language defines.
- `brick.schema.json` describes `/agk/brick.yaml`, the manifest an image carries to become a brick: its ports, its parameters, the secrets it expects and what it needs from the container it is given.
- `envelope.schema.json` describes what travels on a port: `meta` with `run_id`, `step`, `port`, `attempt`, `count` and `produced_at`, and the items with their identities, payloads and attached files.

Every keyword carries a `description` and `examples`, and the build fails without them, because the language reference on the site is a projection of these documents rather than a second description of the same thing.

Fixtures come with them, valid and invalid, and `tools/check.py` holds each schema to its own: a document under `fixtures/<kind>/valid/` must be accepted and one under `invalid/` must be refused. Workflow documents are loaded as YAML 1.2, because a YAML 1.1 parser reads the bare key `on:` as the boolean true and `on:` is how the language spells the trigger block.

Where the documentation states a rule the schema states it, where the documentation is silent the schema takes the reading that cannot contradict it, and the readings that had to be taken are written down in the README rather than left in the files to be discovered.
